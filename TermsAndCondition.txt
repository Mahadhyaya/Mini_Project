A Terms and Conditions agreement can set the tone for your ecommerce website. You'll have the opportunity to set guidelines for how users should behave and what happens if they don't follow your rules, which might have to do with things like:

    Payments
    Returns
    Abusive behavior and language when dealing with customer service
    Attempting to infect your website with malware
    Posting defamatory content in the comments section of blog posts

Through the inclusion of specific clauses, your Terms and Conditions agreement will let users know your rules and requirements, and actions you'll take if they're broken.
